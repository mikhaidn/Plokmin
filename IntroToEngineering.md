# Pre-College STEM Content
This is an organized list for resources I've found useful over the years

## Disclaimer - FIND YOUR OWN SOURCES
1. Most of my knowledge comes from when I applied 8 years ago, skim many resources and see what advice seems to pop up multiple times
2. Learn to trust your reasoning over any individual source
   1. Fact-checking, verification, and validation.
3.  Be aware of the difference between, information you "know" vs information you "know of"
4. You will never learn everything, sometimes defining what you don't know is more important. This is how you ask better questions

## Personal skills that will help you stand out
* Git, "version control", and githucd b.com
  * Git is an open source technology that makes it easier for multiple people to work on the same code documents
  * Understanding basics of how a website like github works will allow you to explore open source projects' code, even if you don't know how to program
  * EXAMPLE: [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/)
  * [Pokemon Showdown Github Repository](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown)
* Learn how to write a document in markdown
* Learn how to

## Suggested Content Platforms
1. [Khan Academy](www.khanacademy.org)
   1. [SAT Prep](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/sat/)
      1. After giving this another look, I believe this will be a solid starting place for understanding/practicing the SAT test
   2. [College Admissions](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/college-admissions)
      1. Ignore everything I said, check this out for more information about college admissions
   3. Suggested courses for you
      1. [Electrical Engineering](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering)
         1. Basics of the field for beginners 
      2. [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab)
         1. Calculus I in college
      3. [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc)
         1. Calculus II in college
      4. [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
         1. Calculus III in college
2. EdX - edx.org
   1. This is a mix between Khan Academy and MIT Opencourseware. Universities are starting to offer free-access coursework so anyone can learn "college-level" material outside of a physical university
   2. [Intro to Engineering and Design](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-engineering-and-design)
      1. I cannot recommend this enough, this is a high level crash course that will help you understand what the different types of engineering are
3. [Mit OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
   1. I originally suggested this website because when I was in high school, it set the standard for free-access college courses. It's on the bottom of this list, not because it has gone downhill, but because the rest of the competition has made the first-year college content much more accessible.
