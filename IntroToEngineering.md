# Pre-College STEM Content
This is an organized list for resources I've found useful over the years  

## Suggested Content Platforms
### [Khan Academy](www.khanacademy.org)
#### [SAT Prep](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/sat/)
After giving this another look, I believe this will be a solid starting place for understanding/practicing the SAT test.
#### [College Admissions](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/college-admissions)
Ignore everything I said, check this out for more information about college admissions.
#### [Electrical Engineering](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering)
### Calculus
   [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab), [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc), and [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) is the equivalent to Calculus I-III in certain colleges.
### [Intro to Engineering and Design](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-engineering-and-design)
   I cannot recommend this enough, this is a high level crash course that will help you understand what engineers have in common, and what separates the disciplines apart.
1. [Mit OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
   1. I originally suggested this website because when I was in high school, it set the standard for free-access college courses. It's on the bottom of this list, not because it has gone downhill, but because the rest of the competition has made the first-year college content much more accessible.

#### Electrical Engineering
ElectroBOOM - [The Pain of Electricity (AC versus DC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp97GjuULX8)
#### Computer Engineering
Computer engineering requires many more prerequisites than the other fields on here. Notably some understanding of `binary arithmatic` and `circuts` will help when watching Ben Eater.

Ben Eater - [Building an 8-bit breadboard computer (Playlist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM), [The world's worst video card?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7rce6IQDWs)

## Disclaimer - FIND YOUR OWN SOURCES
1. Most of my knowledge comes from when I applied 8 years ago, skim many resources and see what advice seems to pop up multiple times
2. Learn to trust your reasoning over any individual source
   1. Fact-checking, verification, and validation.
3.  Be aware of the difference between, information you "know" vs information you "know of"
4. You will never learn everything, sometimes defining what you don't know is more important. This is how you ask better questions

## Extra Credit - Make your own (free) website!
  Understanding basics of how a website like github works will allow you to explore open source projects' code, even if you don't know how to program
