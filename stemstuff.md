# Pre-College STEM Content
This is an organized list for resources I've found useful over the years  

## Suggested Content

#### Intro to Engineering and Design (EdX - Georgia Tech) - [Link](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-engineering-and-design)

The "long story short" of "Engineering" as a discipline, as well as practical examples of what separates many of the sub disciplines. If there were only one resource that I could force upon every soon-to-be STEM student, it would be this. Do yourself a favor and check it out.

#### SAT Prep (Khan Academy) - [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/sat/)

After giving it another look, I believe this will be the best starting place for understanding/practicing the SAT test.

#### College Admissions (Khan Academy) - [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/college-admissions)

Ignore everything I said, check this out for more information about college admissions. I can help answer more questions once you've taught yourself the basics

#### Intro to Electrical Engineering (Khan Academy) - [Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering)

Not much to add, this is practically the same content as most Intro to Electronics courses that any engineer would have to take. Definitely worth the skim!

#### Calculus (Khan Academy) - [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab) | [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) | [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)
These courses cover the same material as what's often referred to as "Calculus I-III". Assuming you eventually will learn it, there's no harm in taking a peek at what makes `derivatives`and  `integrals` so gosh darn useful

#### Mit OpenCourseware - [Link](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
   I originally suggested this website because when I was in high school, it set the standard for free-access college courses. It's on the bottom of this list, not because it has gone downhill, but because the rest of the competition has made the first-year college content much more accessible.

## Favorite STEM Content Creators

Here's a non comprehensive list of some videos made by STEM people I actively follow, the more curious you get, the easier it is to learn about what majors are right for you! Check them out on your own time

If you get carried away, you'll start to be surprised at how much faster you can teach yourself than what school can do.

  
#### Veritasium (Miscellaneous STEM) - [Can a Wind-Powered Car Go Faster Than The Wind?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyQwgBAaBag)
Well, can it?

#### 3Blue1Brown (Math) - [The Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM) (NO MATH PREREQUISITE NEEDED)
This playlist places more emphasis on visualization and intuition, no need to know much math to comprehend it

#### 3Blue1Brown (again) - [But how does bitcoin actually work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)
The best bitcoin TL;DR available

#### Numberphile (Math) - [Mathematics is all about SHORTCUTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdEWCxt8C0M)
The interviewer goes to different professors and they chat about a wide variety of "for fun" math concepts

#### Standup Maths (Math) - [Why is there no equation for the perimeter of an ellipse?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nW3nJhBHL0) 
Corny humor warning

#### Stuff Made Here (Robotics/Mechanical) - [Moving hoop won't let you miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myO8fxhDRW0)
Genuinely the most impressive one-man-show on YouTube from a mechanical standpoint

#### Michael Reeves (Robotics/Mechanical) - [I Built a Surgery Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_BlNA7bBxo)
Self taught, going to destroy the world with pure chaos

#### Mark Rober (Robotics/Mechanical) : [World's Longest Field Goal-Robot vs NFL Kicker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_6my53IlxY)
Ex NASA Engineer

#### ElectroBOOM (Electrical Engineering) - [The Pain of Electricity (AC versus DC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp97GjuULX8)
  He teaches through pain, so you don't have to

#### Steve Mould (Miscellaneous STEM) - [This Drill Powered Spool Proves Me Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcsb1xAv7XA)
No frills, just interesting concepts and well presented. This video is part of a 10,000 Canadian cent challenge with ElectroBOOM

#### Ben Eater (Computer Engineering)
Computer engineering requires a few more prerequisites than the other topics on here. Notably some understanding of `binary arithmatic`, `circuts`, and what `machine code` represents will help when watching Ben Eater.

## Disclaimer - FIND YOUR OWN SOURCES
Most of my knowledge comes from when I applied 8 years ago, skim many resources and see what advice seems to pop up multiple times.

Learn to trust your reasoning over any individual source.

Be aware of the difference between, information you "know" vs information you "know of".

You will never learn everything, sometimes defining what you don't know is more important. This is how you ask better questions.

## Extra Credit - Make your own (free) website!
  Understanding basics of how a website like github works will allow you to explore open source projects' code, even if you don't know how to program
