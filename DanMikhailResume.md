Experience
---------
2022 - Present
: **Software Engineer** at Verily Life Sciences (Alphabet) *(Boston, MA)*

Led full-stack development of two core healthcare platform components with feature flag-controlled deployments in a FHIR/GCP ecosystem:

* **Participant System**: Built a scalable internal service enabling Verily's developers to interact with simplified participant interface
  - Led refactoring of a core data model and system, improving maintainability through service modularization and third-party integration abstraction
  - Reduced testing cycle time by 75% through decoupling frontend/backend test suites in Consent System
  - Authored comprehensive developer guides and contract tests establishing best practices for service integration

* **Provider Console**: Led design and development of a modular frontend dashboard through iterative feedback loops with UX and Product teams
  - Established frontend architecture patterns by implementing core React/TypeScript components, creating a flagship MFE that became standard reference across 4+ teams
  - Broke down card implementation into modular Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architecture enabling parallel development across junior engineers, reducing MVP delivery time by 50%
  - Built reusable UI components following UX specifications, maintaining a11y compliance standards, ensuring aligned quality expectations with Project Management

Technologies: Go, React/TypeScript, GCP, FHIR, gRPC

2018 - 2021
: **Software Production Engineer** at Yahoo! *(Champaign, IL)*

Served as the production point of contact for components of Yahoo!'s DSP advertisement pipeline and tools built primarily on the Hadoop Ecosystem or Amazon Web Service.

- Communicate blockers in-between developer teams, like new a security requirement (COPPA, GDPR, etc.) or data schema change that was deployed ahead of schedule
- Formed a high level intuition of the pipeline to catch potential SLA misses early, and pass on tribal knowledge to newer Production Engineers
- Established a real-time monitoring system using Lambda architecture, providing critical visibility into pipeline health and performance metrics

Technologies: Python, Hadoop Ecosystem (Pig, Oozie, Spark), AWS, RedHat clusters
