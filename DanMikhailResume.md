Led full-stack development of two core healthcare platform components with feature flag-controlled deployments in a FHIR/GCP ecosystem. Technologies include: Go, React/TypeScript, GCP, FHIR, gRPC

* **Participant System**: Built a scalable internal service enabling Verily's developers to interact with simplified participant interface
  - Led refactoring of a core data model and system, improving maintainability through service modularization and third-party integration abstraction
  - Reduced testing cycle time by 75% through decoupling frontend/backend test suites in Consent System
  - Authored comprehensive developer guides and contract tests establishing best practices for service integration

* **Provider Console**: Led design and development of a modular frontend dashboard through iterative feedback loops with UX and Product teams
  - Established frontend architecture patterns by implementing core React/TypeScript components, creating a flagship MFE that became standard reference across 4+ teams
  - Broke down card implementation into modular Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) architecture enabling parallel development across junior engineers, reducing MVP delivery time by 50%
  - Built reusable UI components following UX specifications, maintaining a11y compliance standards, ensuring aligned quality expectations with Project Management

Served as the production point of contact for data pipelines and tools built on the Hadoop Ecosystem. Technologies include: Python, Hadoop Ecosystem (Pig, Oozie, Spark), AWS, RedHat clusters

- Developed a full-stack monitoring tool for multiple Lambda architecture-based streaming pipelines, providing real-time visibility into pipeline health
- Escalate urgent feature requests across the pipeline, like new a security requirement (COPPA, GDPR, etc.), that was deployed ahead of schedule
- Formed a high level intuition of the pipeline to catch potential SLA misses early, and pass on tribal knowledge to newer Production Engineers
- Refined many operational skills and concepts: Key and group management, replication, load balancing, networking, CI/CD, and Linux Bash scripting
