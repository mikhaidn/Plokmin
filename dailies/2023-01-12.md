## TODO
* [[Verily]] laid off 15% of its workforce, I'm not one of them but I feel as if I could have been in another 6 months.
    * I must remain consistent in publicly working and remain persistent enough to complete my thoughts
* Tomorrow I want to go to the gym at lunch and pick up some Toilet paper and sponges
* I'm thinking that I should renew the lease, but I will dislike the lack of an in unit dryer
