# French Macarons 101
A Primer

## French Macarons are Fragile 
Here is an incomplete list of variables that affect the outcome
* Humidity, Elevation, Geography, Oven, Baking sheet, Parchment Paper vs Silicone Mat
* Did the meringue have stiff peaks?
* Did you perform the Macronage (Folding of the dry ingredients into the meringue) properly?
* Did you measure ingredients by volume or by mass?
* What did you set your oven to? 300? 315? 350?
* How long did you leave them in for? 10 minutes then rotate? 15 minutes?

## Fundamental Theorem of Macarons
* Nobody, and I mean *nobody* has a foolproof macaron recipe for a brand new kitchen.

Let go of the idea that you need "picture perfect" macarons, and then you "unlock" the ability to make something tasty and artisanal every time! 

### Key Terms:

**Meringue**
* An egg white and air emulsion. This forms the fluffy structure of a macaron. Understand the difference between a stiff peak and a soft peak. Make sure you don't over beat!
  
**Macronage**
*It's what makes a macaron, a macaron!*
The process of folding the dry ingredients into the meringue. Look up a video on this, you'll understand it much better that way. (Hint watch the one below).

### Equipment Must-Haves
* Oven (Duh)
* Electric Mixer
  * Stand Mixers are nice, but not needed
* Parchment Paper or Silicone Mat
  * The batter/cookies will stick to anything else
* Wide large bowl
  * Preferably metal or glass, as fats/oils linger on plastic, which can destabilize the meringue
* Rubber Spatula
  * For the Macronage


## High Level Ratios
* 1:~2.75 egg white to combined almond flour + powdered sugar by mass
* If you don't have a scale aim to have about 2/3 cup of dry sifted ingredients for each egg white:
  * 3:2 Almond Flour to Powdered Sugar
    * The texture will more closely resemble a cookie in structural integrity 
  * 2:3 Almond Flour to Powdered Sugar
    * The cookies will have a "melt-in-your-mouth" effect
  * 1:1
    * Safe to aim for if you don't have a food scale - worst case scenario you've made one of two extremes - both will be fine!

## High Level Ingredients
### Meringue
* Egg Whites
  * 1 egg white
* Granulated Sugar
  * ~ 1 tablespoon per egg white(1/4 cup for 3) (you should learn to eyeball this as you make the meringue)
* *Optional* Stabilizer (a little goes a long way)
  * ~1/8 tsp Acid (lime Juice) OR Cream of Tartar
* Wet Additives *optional*
  * 1/4-1/2 tsp Vanilla/Anise Extract
  * 1-2 drops Gel Food Coloring


### Dry Ingredients
* 1/2 cup Almond Flour 
* 1/3 cup Powdered Sugar
* *Optional* Dry Flavor Additives
  * 1-2 tsp Cocoa/Matcha Powder (little goes a long way)
  * 1/4 tsp Salt

### Icing
* Buttercream
* Ganache 
* Jams/Preserves/Curds
* Peanut Butter + Butter + Powdered Sugar





## High Level Process
1) MAKE SURE YOUR BOWLS ARE CLEAN AND DRY
   1) If there's any lingering fat or moisture, you make the Meringue process difficult (if not impossible) for yourself
2) Make a Stiff-Peak Meringue with the following: 
   1) Egg Whites
   2) Granulated Sugar
   3) Acid
   4) *Optional* Vanilla, gel food coloring, etc
3) Mix Dry Ingredients in separate bowl
   1) Almond Flour
   2) Powdered sugar
   3) *Optional* Salt, Cocoa Powder, etc
4) Macronage
   1) Add the dry ingredients to the meringue
   2) **Fold* the mixture, focus on "incorporating" the ingredients, while being careful to not pop too much of the "air"
   3) Stop when the batter is "magma-esque", if it is as viscous as honey, you've gone too far, and there's nothing you can do besides start over. (Again, look up a video or two on this)
5) Transfer batter to Silpat/Parchment cookie sheet
   1) Use a spoon (or piping bag) to get ~1inch cookies on a baking sheet.
   2) They will spread out, make sure you leave room (~1.5") in-between them
   3) Smack the air out of them
      1) Lift the baking sheet flat and slam it on a hard surface
6) Let the sheet(s) sit for about 30 minutes, or until there's a firm thin film over all of the cookies
   1) Now is a good time to preheat the oven (300-325)
7) Put the cookies in for about 15 minutes total, rotating once around the halfway mark
   1) If you're making more cookies, opt for a lower temperature and slightly longer baking time
      1) Baking times and temperature is oven dependent, trust your gut over anything written
8) If you think you're done, take the sheet out
      1) Lift the parchment paper and try to "push" each cookie off the paper, if they don't fall off, they need more time
9) Take the sheet out (for real this time) out, let cool
10) Are they cool?
11) Make sure they're cool 
    1)  Seriously, give it at least 10 minutes
    2)  This is a good time to start making the icing
12) Try to pair up cookies as best as possible
13) Add (a little icing) to one half and gently place another a top it
14) You can eat them now, but they get much better after a day in the fridge
